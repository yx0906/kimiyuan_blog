Bag of Words

Vocabulary: Not all words are equal.

Stopwords: low information, highly frequent word - [the, in, for, you, will, have, be]

NLTK

Stemming

\```python

from nltk.stem.snowball import SnowballStemmer

stemmer = SnowballStemmer("english")

stemmer.stem("responsiveness")

stemmer.stem("responsivity")

\```

You want to form word stems before constructing your bag-of-words.
